This repository contains the two projects I did in 2023 for the Laboratory of Computational Physics course during my bachelor's degree.
* ```dc1``` contains the code used for a report analysing the correlation between tweets talking about climate change a demonstrations.
* ```dc2``` contains the code used for a report looking for time causality between the financial market and the price of fossil fuels.
